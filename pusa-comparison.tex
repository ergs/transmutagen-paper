In addition, we have compared our partial fraction digits to those published
in~\cite{pusa2012correction} for degrees 14 and 16. However, many
discrepancies were found. These dependencies are summarized in {\color{red} ???}.

Two values, $\mathrm{re}(\alpha_4)$ and $\mathrm{re}(\alpha_6)$ of degree
16, differed within machine floating point precision (each within one-bit).
