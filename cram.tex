Consider the function $e^{-t}$ on the interval $[0,\infty)$. Let
$\pi_{k,k}\subset \mathbb{R}(t)$ be the set of rational functions $r_{k,k}(t)
= p_k(t)/q_k(t)$, where $p_k(t), q_k(t)\in \mathbb{R}[t]$ are polynomials of
degree at most $k$.

The Chebyshev Rational Approximation Method (CRAM)~\cite{ationneeded}
approximation of degree $k$ for $e^{-t}$ is the unique rational function
$\hat{r}_{k,k}(t)$ such that
\begin{equation}
  \sup_{t\in[0, \infty)}|\hat{r}_{k, k}(t) - e^{-t}|
\end{equation}
is minimized. Let
\begin{equation}
  \epsilon_{k,k} = \inf_{r_{k,k}\in\pi_{k,k}}\left\{\sup_{t\in[0, \infty)}|r_{k, k}(t) - e^{-t}|\right\}.
\end{equation}
$\epsilon_{k,k}$ is the absolute error of the approximation. It has been shown
that $\epsilon_{k,k} = O(H^{-k})$, where $H=9.289\ldots$~\cite{ationneeded} is
known as Halphen's constant.
