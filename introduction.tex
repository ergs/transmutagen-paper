Transmutagen is a Python library for generating fast nuclear transmutation
solvers using the Chebyshev Rational Approximation Method
(CRAM)~\cite{ationneeded} for the matrix exponential. Transmutagen depends on
Python 3.5 and SymPy 1.1 or newer \todo{Other dependencies?}. Transmutagen is
capable of computing the CRAM approximation digits for $e^{-t}$ on
$[0, \infty)$ for any degree, code generating such an approximation using
SciPy's linear algebra routines, and code generating a CRAM approximation into
custom fast C routine for a given sparsity pattern. Transmutagen also contains
utilities for testing the validity of the approximation, both through testing
of mathematical and physical properties, and through comparison of the results
to ORIGEN~\cite{ationneeded}.
