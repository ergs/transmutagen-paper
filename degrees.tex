In our tests, when using CRAM to compute transmutation with machine double
floating point arithmetic, the maximum absolute error was bounded at around
$10^{-14}$. Figure~\ref{fig:degrees} shows how the error levels off at around
degree 16 for a transmutation computation for smaller timesteps and around
degree 18 for larger timesteps. The error in general is higher for higher time
steps. This is because multiplying a matrix $A$ by $t$ scales the spectrum of
$A$ by $t$.

Figure~\ref{fig:error-plot} shows the error of the CRAM approximation in the
complex plane (note that it shows $\hat{r}(-t)$, so that it can be compared
against the spectrum of $A$). Comparing it with
Figures~\ref{fig:eigenvals-pwru50} and~\ref{fig:eigenvals-decay}, it can be
seen that CRAM should provide an accurate approximation for transmutation
matrices, but not for decay matrices.
