Given a square matrix $A$, the matrix exponential is defined
as~\cite{ationneeded}
\begin{equation}
  e^{A} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{A^n}{n!}.
\end{equation}

The CRAM approximation to $e^{-x}$ can be applied to approximate the matrix
exponential when the matrix $A$ has eigenvalues on or near the negative real
axis~\cite{pusa2010computing}. This applies to transmutation and decay
matrices.
